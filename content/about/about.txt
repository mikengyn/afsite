Person1body: 

Born in Hong Kong, Neil moved to Calgary with his family at the age of two. He is currently a
                    management student at the University of Lethbridge (Calgary campus) with a concentration in
                    marketing. Neil’s interest in photography began in high school, where he picked up his first camera
                    and took it with him on a trip to Europe. It was there that he gained a strong enthusiasm for travel
                    and photography. Growing up, Neil was strongly influenced by music and art. After years of study,
                    Neil became intrigued with the raw and powerful emotion of wedding photography and capturing the
                    essence of a simple moment in time that can be remembered forever.

Person2body: 

Thomas is an experienced photographer specializing in portraits, lifestyle, and wedding photography.
                    Formally trained at Alberta College of Art and Design, Thomas takes a stylistic and candid approach
                    to his work. He enjoys the simple pleasures in life such as creating photographs and travelling the
                    world to expand his horizons. Thomas’s passion for the art of wedding photography stems from the
                    belief that every person has an amazing story to share. When it comes to weddings and the unity of
                    two strangers, what shines through is the beauty and richness of their two separate stories becoming
                    one. This is the motivation he uses to make sure he captures consistently high quality photographs,
                    every single time.
